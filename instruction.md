Engineering Possibilities, Together.

INVITE ONLY HACKATHON

Welcome to this experimental hackathon featuring the newly built Cartesi Coprocessor leveraging EigenLayer! This week is not only about building—it's also a stress test for the technology and documentation. Expect to explore, experiment, and provide valuable feedback.
What is Cartesi

Cartesi’s virtual machine brings a proper operating system to Ethereum and beyond. Decades of existing libraries, languages, and tooling. The simplest path to building the next generation of onchain applications.
What is EigenLayer

EigenLayer provides developers with access to the Ethereum staked capital base and decentralized validator set. Access to this trust network can make previously impossible mechanism designs possible.
About Experiment Week

This event is designed to emphasize experimentation and building to explore new possibilities. It’s a unique opportunity where we put our solutions to the test, resonating deeply with the developer journey by building with our own infrastructure. This hackathon is primarily invite-only, but we welcome seasoned developers eager to dive deeper into the technology. If you're up for the challenge, we’d love to have you on board!

Experiment Week is about bringing those possibilities to life, with core protocol developers and community members from both projects rolling up their sleeves, pushing the limits of their own tech, and inspiring builders to explore new possibilities that unlock Web3’s true potential.
The Challenge

Participants are tasked with creating innovative PoCs and dApps that leverage the combined features of Cartesi and EigenLayer or tools and frameworks that enhance the developer experience and unlock new possibilities with the Coprocessor. These projects should:

1. Address meaningful use cases in Web3:

    Solutions that tackle current problems like scalability, interoperability.
    Showcase how the Coprocessor infrastructure, securely offloading complex computations to the Cartesi Machine, brings innovation to the web3 space.

2. Explore untapped horizons within decentralized technology.

    New use cases that are enabled by the combination of Cartesi and EigenLayer: AI Integration, Games, Data-Driven Applications, DeFi Innovations.
    Create new frameworks, and tools that allow users and developers to do more and have a better experience.

3. Have clear delivery of the solution:

    Bonus points for projects deployed on testnet.
    Demonstrate end-to-end interaction between all components of your solution.
    Provide clear documentation and instructions for testing and replicating your solution.
